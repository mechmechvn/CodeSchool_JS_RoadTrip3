***Final Closed Values II

Now the Dev Girls need each shark to be matched with a corresponding target. A shark’s index in the listOfSharks array will match the index of the target that it is supposed to eliminate from listOfTargets.

var listOfSharks = ["Sea Pain", "Great Wheezy",
                    "DJ Chewie", "Lil' Bitey",
                    "Finmaster Flex", "Swim Khalifa",
                    "Ice Teeth", "The Notorious J.A.W."];

var listOfTargets = ["icicle bat", "snow yeti",
                     "killer penguin", "frost tiger",
                     "polar bear", "iceberg",
                     "blue witch", "wooly mammoth"];
Inside the makeTargetAssigner function:

// First, return an anonymous function that takes in a shark parameter.
// Inside the function that is being returned, create a for loop to loop through the sharks array.
//Inside the loop, find out if the current shark from the sharks array matches the shark name that is getting passed as a parameter.
//If those values match, build an alert message that produces the following output after calling the getTargetFor function:
Hey, Ice Teeth!
There've been blue witch sightings in our area!
Time to take care of business!
Note: You do not need to edit the provided function call at the bottom. Just build out the makeTargetAssigner function to complete the challenge.

function makeTargetAssigner(sharks, targets) {
  // insert your code here
  return function(shark) {
    for (var i = 0; i < sharks.length; i++) {
      if (sharks[i] == shark) {
        alert("Hey, " + shark + "!\n" +
              "There've been " + targets[i] +
              " sightings in our area!\n" +
              "Time to take care of business!")
      }
    };
  }
}

var getTargetFor = makeTargetAssigner(listOfSharks,
                                      listOfTargets);
getTargetFor("Ice Teeth");
