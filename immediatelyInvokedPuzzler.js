/*
**Now the Poplar Puzzle-makers have sent you a puzzle with a new set of functions to use on that puzzle. To display your overwhelming array and function expression mastery, alert the answer to the following question:

“What is obtained when the result of passing 9 into the fourth function of the puzzlers array is then passed into the function whose array index matches the result of passing 3 into the second function of the puzzlers array?”

To really impress them, the expression used in your alert should:

*Use just one line of code.
*Involve no manual calculation or hard-coded math on your part.
*Use indices of arrays to access functions.
*Use parentheses to pass in parameters to immediately-invoking functions.
Note:

* The required answer is not an example of good style, nor is it intended as such.
* The main point is to give you practice with the mechanics of arrays and function calls.
