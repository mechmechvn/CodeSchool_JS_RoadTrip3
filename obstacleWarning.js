**Highway to the Danger Zones

The Dev Girls need you to store each location so that a list of danger zones for each obstacle can be reported with every new warning.

Inside the warningMaker function:

*Store each location in an array called zones.
*Add each zone to the list string.
*Report the list of danger zones with the alert message in this format:
***Beware! There have been <obstacle> sightings in the Cove today!
<number> have been spotted at the <location>!
This is alert #<count> today for <obstacle> danger.
Current danger zones are:
<zone1>
<zone2>
<zone3>
